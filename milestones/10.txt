 real and to see me?  It was a gamble.  |_____________________________________|
 All options, reincarnation, heaven...
 trusting that someone that understood even existed? All seemed so equally far-
 fetched. And they all had their own catches!  Ending my own life would deny me
 Jesus's love somehow, even if I had accepted him. Reincarnation was no panacea
 either, I could spend twenty lives  in worms and rodents before another chance
 as a woman. I looked out at that channel, catching my breath on the board, and
 pondered if I had come here to be lost. It would be only partially my fault. A
 few paddles out into the channel, and minutes would lay between life and death
 far enough from anyone else to even be seen much less gather help.  Sitting on
 the board, I felt free, decider of my fate.  I had gotten myself out here and,
 arms willing,  I could make my way back.  And then what? No choices were good,
 but also no choices could follow death. No certainty, but also no chance.
   I had rowed to this sandbar to test my limits, and here I sat, deciding. If,
 then, repeat. What I did every day determined the rest of my life, but instead
 of feeling that agency I felt only dread.  I chose that moment to set aside my
 need for that agency in hopes of a future I couldn't see. Sitting exhausted on
 that board at the edge of the world under a murderous sun, I killed my ego.
