 By the fifth grade I had read about various theories of life after death and
 reincarnation seemed the most pleasing of them, until just this instant.
   The lay minister (?) was about to start another topic and then I blurted out
 "Can you choose!?"  I put my hand up as I had asked but still felt embarrassed
 immediately.  She scolded me  for not waiting to be called on.  I felt like my
 body had just been following my mind's desires as it heard something *amazing*
 and the rest just followed along. I could feel my face warming, blushing.
   "I'm sorry, um, I wanted to know, can you *choose* what you look like in
 Heaven?"
   "Jesus will see you as the best version of yourself. It is not for us to
 decide that. I would--"
   "But would Jesus know what we want?" Snickers. Stares. My hair stood on end.
   "You want to be thin then?" another boy said. Laughter.
   "Everyone! Heads down. Now."                        _______         ____
