So welcome! Now that you're here, how do you get around? Well, I'm sure you've
realized by now that you press the return (enter) key to go to the next page.
This is true for all parts of the magazine except for the index. There, you can
just press the number for the story you want to read. The magazine will tell
you which number you pressed, and you'll be on the way to the story. That's it,
it's pretty simple!
