                         An Old Man's Story by June Martin
It's a secret number, you just punch it in. My grand-dad taught it to me, got it
from his. Tommy Watson. Don't fall for that Thomas shit, no one who knew him 
would say that. Inventor of the phone, you know. The real one. Bell barely did
anything. 

No listen to me. 

Listen to me. 

Bell got people on the line. But it's not for that. It's a weapon. Yeah, a 
weapon. Oh look it’s a crazy old drunk, oh he's deluded. I got a perfect mind of
glass. Don’t you worry about that, friends. Phones make a network. You get them
to build a network. Back then it was just wires, that was bad enough. Now it's 
signals. Can't throw a hatchet on your back and go protect your town like ol 
grand-dad. 

Look I'll show you. Give me your phone. Because I don't carry one, that’s why. 
Too dangerous. You'll see. You, what's your phone number? Thanks kid, love your 
attitude. So you just pop the right stuff in, then the phone number of the 
recipient and hey, there you go.

Stop trying, he's not gonna wake up. I called him off this mortal coil. And be 
quiet. Thank you. Christ.
