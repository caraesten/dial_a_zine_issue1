My point… stop, that boy’s brains are soup. Can’t do anything with ‘em anymore. 
My point. It’s the greatest weapon ever made. Nuclear bombs, ICBMs… cannons. 
None of em match up. 

Oh yeah call the cops, what’re you gonna say? I mean you got that thing to your
ear right now, two numbers and your ear’s popped and you’re deaf forever. 
Fighting phones with phones. You kids. Anyone want to know why? No? Great 
grand-dad’s wisdom, gratis, and this is the thanks I get. You build a bomb when
you want everyone to get scared. Big explosion, no doubt that’s the death. A 
sonic weapon? Invisible. That’s for racking up body, after body, after body. 

Hello officers. No idea. He just fell over. Look, look. They’re kids, they’re 
wasted. Hey! Anyone see me lay a finger on the dead kid? See? No. Probably had
an aneurysm. Kids these days get jacked up on speed and try to slow things down
with some booze and then pop. Done. I appreciate you coming out here, boys, I
know it’s tough. God bless.

See, that’s what I’m saying. Untraceable. But it’s not about that. Get a guy’s
number and he’s toast, that’s small time. Waste of infrastructure. I got his
number because I wanted to aim. What if you didn’t? 

Don’t get that running look in your eye. Just like a rabbit. This phone has
contacts. I can work my way down a list. What was I saying? Right.
