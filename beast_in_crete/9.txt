 I know - and they must know, for I hide no thing - that my courses of action, 
 in thought, in dream, split along arbitrary, incessant binaries: A, B, left,  
 right, inward, outward, clockwise, anticlockwise, bellow, mutter, hunt, flee. 
                                                                               
 Into this equation some days ago was introduced aThe hero: agent of adversity,
 gnat unrelenting, ever-failing bulwark against my dominion. Some thing to     
 shape my exploration besides walls, cattle prod in the shape of legend.       
                                                                               
 I answer now your lingering question about my choice of grammatical markings. 
 Yes, the mark is an invention of my own. No one was here to teach me your     
 script, I deduced it from a succession of codices in the hexagonal towers.    
 Not all of the translational precedent was sufficient for my thinking.        
 I am stuck in certain loops and so I employ language that comforts my station.
                                                                               
 I can speak of a dove or of The Central Atrium, but I cannot meaningfully     
 distinguish between aThe hero who is singular and aThe hero who is one of     
 many. Sword, ship, thread, maze, I will never deny belonging to continuum.    
                                                                               
 When I recommence journey from the same place I was born, having              
 circumnavigated labyrinth, there are objects and events I know to expect.     
 I hold a ball of twine. I listen to the sirens' wail. aThe hero returns with  
 some regularity to torment me, to be dispatched with guilty ease. There are   
 deaths and there are maps and a story is built and rebuilt. I can only hope   
 the jailers learn something from this infernal process. Perhaps you will.
