 in my own line of work. Oftentimes the difficulty lies in apportioning the    
 risk of inevitable damage between the immediate and the eventual.             
                                                                               
 Might I request once more your estimate of architect's aim? I grasp rationales
 for containment, but I lack evidence of a motive in the complications.        
                                                                               
 And I really do mean it, wholeheartedly, when I echo your desire to see the   
 world unbounded. This is the uncompromising soul of my work for the Society.
