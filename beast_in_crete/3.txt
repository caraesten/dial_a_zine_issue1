 I do not know the faces of my captors, for I have never witnessed them.       
 I only always hear voices, and some times see lengthened unplaceable shadows. 
 I speak of captors and voices, uncounted, for they reach me in chorus.        
 The caves are never without echo, or perhaps the echo does not end.           
 They never speak to me, or perhaps they always sing of me.                    
 The report is never directed towards my self in name, but seeks things only I

 A cow, yes, her skull has not washed away. Her hide is long gone. No sire
