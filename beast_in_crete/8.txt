 I have witnessed near totality the turns of this conversation and I have found
 baleful frustration in each ending that does not draw freedom.                
                                                                              
 I am often preoccupied with these visions of else, they are so tempting an    
 escape they unavoidably overlap with my present tense. I am every day faced   
 with the choice of interaction with the world or solitary prefiguation.       
 The world is provably cruel, I believe my preference is understood.           
                                                                              
 Would you not also react with fierceness to interrupted reveries? I hold this 
 aspect of a sundowning savant and I am given to understand that my outbursts, 
 being indefensible violations of narrative flow, have caused some to call me  
 cannibal, deceiver. I am a monster in a maze and in a way I live forever.     
                                                                              
 They speak in their sideways chattering of costly retcons, of necessities for 
 restraint. Perhaps in castigation is admission of ruse? With a memory too     
 knottily crosshatched to reveal my role in alleged atrocities, I hypothesize a
 history in which I am held under false pretext. I consider being bound by     
 nothing more than need of my talents. I picture this exonerative zone with    
 intent to map with slow care, sorrowfully savoring its finitude, dreading a   
 final turn and a long march back to an opposite conclusion.                   
                                                                              
 I hold also hope that I was not born this way, that time in the maze tortured 
 a once-palatial mind into this desolation of forked corridors. I always dream 
 that if I never again woke to branching halls, then my head might heal.
