 Doctor,                                                                      
 or perhaps Director,                                                         
                                                                               
 Thank you for a rare promise. It can fan my hopes for resituation, or perhaps 
 it gifts a novel diversion. Letters do seem more concrete proof of ongoing    
 elsewhere than other drifts that shores snare; for this, I hold them as balm. 
                                                                               
 Incapable or unknowing, absent jailers have not sought fit to intercede.      
 And I must conclude the risk of becoming an other sort of captive is          
 reasonable. Make your motions and I will meet the interposition with relief.  
                                                                               
 Some orders of correction and difference. Since last I wrote,                 
                                                                               
 The stars have chosen a different ecliptic, the sirens have begun a new song. 
                                                                               
 The southwestern corridor I spoke of as loop connects now to something other  
 than itself. Its length is shrunken something closer to measurable.           
                                                                               
 The fourteen pillars are now eleven. I have given them all new names.         
                                                                               
 My inventory has grown by three copper coins, a feather, and a glass bottle.  
 The scuba tank and paraffin are no more. I do appreciate the candles and ream.
 It is a shame that less than the whole of the meat materialized, and the      
 extant quantity had rotted before arrival.
