Dear Maya,

        I hope you're doing okay and making friends. You should be, there's
really no excuse not to. Everyone gets nervous, everyone feels like they are
in the wrong place, even the ones who're in charge. You don't have to be scared
of them. If anyone gives you trouble just look them in the eye and kick them in
the shins.

        I'm sorry, I didn't write this to give advice. I just don't know how to
talk about middle-of-the-heart stuff. "How have you been" is how I should have
started off. So. How have you been? I hope this letter finds you in good health
and...well?

        I'm sorry, that sounded terrible. So forced, like this will end with
"sincerely" or "warmest regards" or "your most ob'dnt servant". I should stick
to regular language and avoid Civil War love letter, lol. That last one would be
kind of hot though. "Dearest Maya, My heart pangs in the shadow of your absence
and my loins are aflame with longing for your strict touch and firm voice. I beg
your indulgence-"

        I'm sorry, this is really getting away from me. I guess I'll try to...
I dunno, just say it I guess: I miss you.
I miss you with everything.
I miss your everything.
