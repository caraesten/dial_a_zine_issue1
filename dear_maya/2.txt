I miss the annoyingly catchy songs you would make up about cleaning or moving
the microwave. I miss the way you would laugh so hard you couldn't breathe if I
just rocked you back and forth. I miss touching you, miss letting you pop zits
on my back and holding your hand while you drove. I miss the smell of coffee and
the taste of cereal in orange juice, and the seeds all over the counter from you 
smooshing an everything bagel into your bagel cutter. I even miss sleeping in 
the bed alone when you decided the sofa was your favorite place, because I still 
knew you were just in the other room, a physical presence I could go poke or 
annoy or cuddle.

And I know you miss me too. I know you loved me. I don't even know what took me
away, it was so fast (I hope it was something not too scary and not too messy, 
instead of like a bullet or plane crash or something). We aren't allowed any 
contact with the world after we die unless we're returning on official business.
Otherwise I'd be haunting your ass every minute of every day, just like we 
promised. 

Here's the good news though: I'm officially allowed to return! I volunteered for
the first opening that gave me a chance, so starting in March I'll be around. 
You won't be able to see me, but I'll be on major disaster duty. Anytime a death
toll surpasses a dozen dozen you'll know it's me, softly saying I love you,
I missed you, and I'll never leave you again, I swear.
            See you as soon as I can my delight, my love!
            Your most ob'dnt servant <3
