Q. Can Manak be avoided by disentangling oneself from "the clout game"?
A. No. The "clout game" is a weapon Manak uses, but not the only one. Fame is,
after all, older than the Internet, and Manak was first observed in the 1970s.
In fact, one of the people who can be seen as "safest" from Manak's grasp in
a certain sense are those in the thrall of the principalities of fame and glory.
To call this "going from the frying pan to the fire" is an understatement. These
principalities are so mighty and dreadful they remain better unnamed. Nations
have burned and millions have died to slake their horrible thirsts. Granted,
once the cycle of creation becomes secondary to accolades for someone, Manak's
ability to influence them seriously weakens; but this method of escape has
predictable and unenviable consequences for all aspects of human life.
Q. What are signs someone is inhabited by Manak?
A. Hosts of Manak strain against the limitations of the human body. In older
hosts, it is the weakness of the body that galls them; in younger hosts, usually
merely its slowness and tendency to fatigue. They judge themselves not by their
own standards but by those of their passenger. The brain, also, presents Manak
with both an opportunity and an obstacle, and hosts will tend to medicate it
freely. As with other demons of the arts, the posting demon encourages its hosts
to indulge in depressants, stimulants, psychedelics, and to waste drugs that
others would use on socializing chasing after artistic achievement. A noteworthy
host recently spent his first acid trip "posting through it", losing ungodly
sums of money doing so, when his famously beautiful spouse was *right there*.
In a sense, the greatest loss one suffers hosting Manak is the loss of connect-
-ion. The vast ability of art to communicate is squandered, becomes white noise.
