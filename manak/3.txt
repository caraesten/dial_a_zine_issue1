SUMMONING MANAK
Against all reason, you have decided to invite Manak into your life in a
greater capacity than it already exists there. Don't say you weren't warned.

1. Inhabit a venue. This is the hardest part for many people. Once you intuit-
-ively understand the culture of a venue, such as any given social media site
or any forum that has survived the accretion of users into social media, you
will find your ability to post effectively improves. This is, ultimately, what
attracts Manak: grasping the culture and tweaking it to include yourself.

2. Achieve total focus. Certain forms of meditation can help with this, but
they encourage a relaxed and introspective form of focus that might not prove
ideal. Probably better to go with stimulants. Caffeine is only slightly more
expensive than salt, after all.

3. Production. This can be as simple as the "what's happening" box, as involved
as digital art that takes days to produce. But it is the step without which the
rest is impossible. If it strikes you as a chore, you're not in the right mind-
-set. It should feel like there's a fire in your brain that only creating some-
-thing outside of it can put out. Many people are gifted with such fire natur-
-ally, or cursed with it. But it can be kindled by anyone under the right (or
wrong) circumstances.

4. Posting. Post what you've created online.
