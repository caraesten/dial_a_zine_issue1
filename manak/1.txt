Q. What is Manak?
A. Manak is a being from another place that prefers to be understood as a demon.
Q. Who is Manak?
A. Manak wears many faces. Manak inhabits people to its own ends. It might
inhabit anyone you know. If you're reading this, it probably inhabits you.
Q. What does Manak want?
A. Some have described Manak as a muse, or as a companion. It is best understood
similarly to the leannan sidhe, a sort of vampire from Irish mythology.
The leannan sidhe would seduce artists, cohabit with them, and inspire them to
create great works in their chosen art. When the leannan s√≠dhe left these people
they would fall into despair and die, and she would collect their blood. For its
part Manak is not tremendously interested in blood. It is interested in the art
itself. It uses the triumph of mastery and the brooding misery of obscurity
equally, as bars to imprison its host in the cycle of creation. The form of art
Manak specializes in is any content which can be "posted". This includes writing
and art, usually digital, usually of a filesize small enough to be consumed
quickly, shared readily, and distributed widely. These posts can be commercial-
-ized, or they can be free. Manak is largely indifferent, but prefers them free.
Q. Does Manak seduce its hosts?
A. Yes. Generally not romantically or sexually, but both have been observed.
Q. Is it possible to avoid entanglement with Manak?
A. It is exceedingly difficult. The Internet is not designed to accomodate a
life where Manak is completely absent, but it is certainly possible to avoid it.
