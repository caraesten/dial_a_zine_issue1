5. Eternal return. Did the post not "land" to your satisfaction? You didn't in-
-habit the venue thoroughly enough, or weren't focused enough. If you seek the
influence of Manak inside you, you cannot fault the posts themselves. The posts
are everything, and you are nothing. You have to go back to the drawing board,
somehow. You have to start over. It's not enough. It's not enough. It's never
enough.



                         If the world does turn
                         And if London burns
                         I'll be standing on the beach
                         with my guitar
                         I wanna be in a band
                         when I get to Heaven
                         Anyone can play guitar
                         and they won't be a nothing anymore
